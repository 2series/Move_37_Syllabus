- Group Discussion in Slack

### Course Objective

Reinforcement learning is driving some of the latest advances in AI, from DeepMind's AlphaGo to OpenAI's DOTA bots. Although these AIs are designed for video games, reinforcement learning is a powerful branch of AI that can be applied to endless applications in the real world. In this course, we'll cover various RL techniques in order of increasing complexity, applying them to both simulated and real world problems. Students will develop an intuition around when to use certain RL algorithms and by the end of the course will have the practical skills necessary to apply RL to a problem they are passionate about to make a positive impact in the world. 

#### Course Length
- 10 Weeks
- 10-15 hours of dedicated study per week

#### Tools Used
- Pytorch (Deep Learning Library)
- OpenAI Gym (Reinforcement Learning Library)
- Google Colab (for free GPUs, no need to install/configure with dependencies)
